<p>I am a mathematical physicist based in London.  
My research is in the field of topological solitons. 
In particular, I look at low-dimensional models where fermions are coupled to the soliton field.</p>
<p>I did my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the 
<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science">School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science</a> 
in the University of Kent. 
I was supervised by <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/963/krusch-steffen">Steffen Krusch</a>. 
I have an M.A. in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge. I have a Graduate Diploma in Mathematics, 
and an M.Sc. in Theoretical Physics, from King's College London (University of London). 
At KCL, I wrote a graduate dissertation on Monopoles and the Mathematics of Gauge Theory for the Graduate Diploma,
and a Master's thesis on Chern-Simons Theory as a Topological Quantum Field Theory for the M.Sc.</p>
<p>From October 2023 I will be a Visiting Lecturer on the <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/prospective-students/courses/foundation/introduction-to-mathematics">Mathematics Foundation Programme</a> at City University of London. I am also a part-time Graduate Teaching Assistant at King's College London. I offer private tutoring in mathematics
 or theoretical physics subjects to undergraduate students in London, as well as A-level tutoring in mathematics.
 If you are interested, please get in touch at the e-mail address given below.</p>

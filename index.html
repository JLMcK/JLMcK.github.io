<p>I am a mathematical physicist based in London. I am a lecturer at City St George's, University of London. 
My research is in the field of topological solitons. 
In particular, I look at low-dimensional models where fermions are coupled to the soliton field.</p>
<p>I am a Visiting Lecturer at <a href="https://www.citystgeorges.ac.uk/about/schools/science-technology/mathematics">City St George's, University of London</a>. I am primarily engaged on the <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/prospective-students/courses/foundation/introduction-to-mathematics">Mathematics Foundation Programme</a>, 
on which I am a lecturer, tutor and Personal Tutor. 
I also lecture on the undergraduate mathematics programme. 
I am an organiser of the Maths Learning Café, a thrice-weekly event series where we run a relaxed space where students can drop in for a chat with their lecturers, get help with assignments, or just pick up a hot drink and a light snack. 
The goals of this event series are to:
	<ul>
		<li>Arrange an alternative and attractive setting for Lecturers’ office hours, which we know are underutilised!</li>
		<li>Provide some food to students who come to classes without eating in the morning.</li>
		<li>Help foster a sense of community, both with the faculty and with each other, for students in all stages.</li>
		<li>Ultimately, aid progression by encouraging students to work on their assignments on campus and take up the support we offer.</li>
	</ul></p>
 <p>I did my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the 
<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science">School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science</a> 
in the University of Kent. 
I was supervised by <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/963/krusch-steffen">Steffen Krusch</a>. 
I have an M.A. in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge. I have a Graduate Diploma in Mathematics, 
and an M.Sc. in Theoretical Physics, from King's College London (University of London). 
At KCL, I wrote a graduate dissertation on Monopoles and the Mathematics of Gauge Theory for the Graduate Diploma,
and a Master's thesis on Chern-Simons Theory as a Topological Quantum Field Theory for the M.Sc.</p>
<p>I offer private tutoring in mathematics
 or theoretical physics subjects to undergraduate students in London, as well as A-level tutoring in mathematics.
